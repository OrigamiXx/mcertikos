// Simple logging. Each system call that might write the file system
// should be surrounded with begin_trans() and commit_trans() calls.
//
// The log holds at most one transaction at a time. Commit forces
// the log (with commit record) to disk, then installs the affected
// blocks to disk, then erases the log. begin_trans() ensures that
// only one system call can be in a transaction; others must wait.
//
// Allowing only one transaction at a time means that the file
// system code doesn't have to worry about the possibility of
// one transaction reading a block that another one has modified,
// for example an i-node block.
//
// Read-only system calls don't need to use transactions, though
// this means that they may observe uncommitted data. I-node and
// buffer locks prevent read-only calls from seeing inconsistent data.
//
// The log is a physical re-do log containing disk blocks.
// The on-disk log format:
//   header block, containing sector #s for block A, B, C, ...
//   block A
//   block B
//   block C
//   ...
// Log appends are synchronous.
