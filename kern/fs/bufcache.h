// Buffer cache.
//
// The buffer cache is a linked list of buf structures holding
// cached copies of disk block contents. Caching disk blocks
// in memory reduces the number of disk reads and also provides
// a synchronization point for disk blocks used by multiple processes.
//
// Interface:
// * To get a buffer for a particular disk block, call bread.
// * After changing buffer data, call bwrite to write it to disk.
// * When done with the buffer, call brelse.
// * Do not use the buffer after calling brelse.
// * Only one process at a time can use a buffer,
//   so do not keep them longer than necessary.
//
// The implementation uses three state flags internally:
// * B_BUSY: the block has been returned from bread
//           and has not been passed back to brelse.
// * B_VALID: the buffer data has been read from the disk.
// * B_DIRTY: the buffer data has been modified
//            and needs to be written to disk.
